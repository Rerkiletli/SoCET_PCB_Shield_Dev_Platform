Grade: 34/100%

Schematic: 34/70%
PCB: 0/30%


----- Schematic -----

Power Supply: 10/15%

Notes: Missing decoupling capacitors for the input and a missing zener diode.


Main IC: 10/30%

Notes: There are floating pins.


Routing: 10/15%

Notes: Don't create a separate schematic for power supply, you can bring that to the main schematic.


Testing Capabilities: 0/5%

Notes: Add LEDs indicating TX, RX, and LEDs for power indications.


Neatness: 4/5%

Notes: Could be better if you add dashed borders.
